# Android Application Project Template

This README outlines the steps and structure for developing an Android application using Python and Kivy. The example project demonstrates integrating Python with Android Java classes via the `pyjnius` library.

## Project Overview

The project is designed to:

1. Build a basic Android application interface using Kivy.
2. Utilize the `pyjnius` library for accessing Android system features.
3. Explore integration with Android's `PackageManager` and `TelephonyManager`.

### **Disclaimer**

This project is intended for educational purposes only. Any misuse or unethical development based on this guide is strictly prohibited.

---

## Features

- **Basic UI**: Create an interface with buttons and labels using Kivy.
- **System Integration**: Access Android system classes using `pyjnius`.
- **Service Example**: Demonstrate how background services could be implemented (without malicious intent).

## Prerequisites

1. **Python Environment**:
   - Install Python 3.x.
   - Install Kivy (`pip install kivy`).
   - Install `pyjnius` (`pip install pyjnius`).

2. **Android Development Tools**:
   - Android Studio or similar IDE.
   - Knowledge of Android app permissions and features.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository or download the source files.
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed.
3. Modify the `main.py` file to implement desired functionality (e.g., creating a benign background service).
4. Build the APK using tools like `buildozer`.

## Code Overview

Here is a snippet of the main application code:

```python
from kivy.app import App
from kivy.uix.label import Label
from kivy.uix.button import Button
from kivy.uix.boxlayout import BoxLayout
from pyjnius import autoclass

class MyAndroidApp(App):
    def build(self):
        layout = BoxLayout(orientation='vertical')
        label = Label(text="My Android App")
        layout.add_widget(label)

        button = Button(text="Perform Action")
        button.bind(on_press=self.perform_action)
        layout.add_widget(button)

        return layout

    def perform_action(self, instance):
        # Implement your functionality here
        pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    MyAndroidApp().run()
```
